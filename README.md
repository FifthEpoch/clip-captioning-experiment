## Setup

Download pretrained model by visiting CLIP prefix captioning's [Github page](https://github.com/rmokady/CLIP_prefix_caption). Since we are focused on generating captions for conceptual images (3D renderings), we will use the Conceptual Captioning pretrained model. Save the model in a new directory named "pretrained" (clip-captioning-experiment/pretrained/<model_weight.pkl>).
